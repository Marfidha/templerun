                <h1 class="hd" > We Are Imangi Studios</h1>
                <p class="p1" >IN THE BEGINNING… Imangi Studios was founded by husband and  wife team Keith Shepherd and Natalia Luckyanova in 2008 with  the goal
                 of creating fun family-friendly games for everyone to enjoy! In 2011 the studio developed the mega-hit Temple Run and in 2013
                 developed another mega-hit Temple Run 2. Combined, these two games have been downloaded over 2.5 billion times. Imangi Studios
                 has also developed Temple Run: Brave (with Pixar), Temple Run: Oz (with Disney), Max Adventure and Harbor Master.</p>
                 <p class="p2" >TODAY: Imangi has grown out of its startup phase and entered into its next phase, one of growth. Imangi is now led by a team
                 of industry veterans and focused on publishing successful games, developing new Temple Run games, and forming partnerships
                 with other companies.</p><p class="p3" >This focus on growth has seen Imangi exand in terms of its team size, but also its
                     strategy and scope. Imangi is focused on
                 growing and developing the Temple Run brand through a variety of opportunities including new mobile games (both runner 
                 non-runner) and beyond. Imangi is developing a team and culture that reflects the Temple Run mantra of Fun, Wonder, Danger
                 , and Adventure!</p>
